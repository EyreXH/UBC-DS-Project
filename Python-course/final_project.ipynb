    "## Question(s) of interests\n",
    "In this analysis, I will be investigating a question associated with the collection of Disney datasets. I am interested in finding which animation director creates the most revenue gross for Disney. It is interesting because Disney is one of the most successful animation movie productions companies, and we can find some clues of how the animation industry changes over the years. We all know people have different tastes in the arts, especially the movies, but the economic benefits of a movie are straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "My favourite Disney director is **[Byron Howard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Howard)**. He directed the [Zootopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zootopia), which won the 2016 Oscar and is also my favourite Disney animation. Although Howard is an amazing director, he is more an animator but a director for many years. This means that Howard hasn't directed a lot of movies yet. In order to make a more reasonable guess, I did some research and found a \"[Top Animation Directors Ever](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls056336503/)\" list. \n"

    "The first is \"[Walt Disney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney)\", who is great but we can not count him because he is all the Disney movies producer. The second and third are \"[Hayao Miyazaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki)\" and \"[John Lasseter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lasseter)\", who are fabulous but not Disney director. The fourth is \"[Ron Clements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Clements)\" who directs \"[The Little Mermaid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid_(1989_film))\", \"[Hercules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules_(1997_film))\", \"[The Princess and the Frog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_and_the_Frog)\" etc. and yes, a Disney director. Therefore, I would expect **Ron Clements** to be the animation director who creates the most revenue gross for Disney.\n",

Then it slows down and creates one animation almost every $5$ years. Since `1980`, Disney started to create movies every year and get a high number gross every $3-4$ years. Generally, the number keeps growing from `1980` and doubles quickly in `1987`. It reaches its first peak around `1995` and decreases slightly from `2000` to `2012`. After that, the number increases again and reaches the third-highest gross in Disney history in `2016`.\n",

    "In this project, I analyzed the Disney dataset and tried to find which director creates the most revenue. Before answering this question, I did some exploratory data analysis to see which movies gain the most revenue, how is the total revenue of Disney movies changes over the year. Generally, there is an increasing trend in the total number since $1980$. However, the animations released in $1930-1960$ are so popular and gorgeous and win the top revenue. That nearly determined the result because the top three directors are all active in $1930-1960$. The top first, **David Hand** is the director of \"[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_White_and_the_Seven_Dwarfs_(1937_film))\" and \"[Bambi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambi)\". The second, **Wolfgang Reitherman**, I have introduced that he directed \"[101 Dalmatians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Hundred_and_One_Dalmatians)\", \"[The Jungle Books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jungle_Book_(1967_film))\" etc. The third, **[Ben Sharpsten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Sharpsteen)**, is the director of \"[Pinocchio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinocchio_(1940_film))\" and \"[Dumbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumbo)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "My assumption **Ron Clements** is still the director who creates the most revenue in the recent $40$ years since $1980$. If we ignore the effects of the inflation-adjusted rates, he can indeed win the first price. However, it will be unfair to compare the revenue without the adjustment. Let's still follow the inflation adjust gross in this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I did a lot of research on animations, and they bring my memory back to when I was a kid. Regardless of the inflation rate, one of the reasons that the animations in $1930-1960$  got that much achievement is because people at that time were longing for pure and childish happiness. Those directors, in a way, create some lovely dreams for both children and adults.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another question that could be looked at given this dataset is to find the most welcome genre movies. One could look at which genre has created the most revenue over the years. This is interesting because Disney has produced different types of movies. It is meaningful for us to have some ideas about which genre is the most popular one. We can also see how the audience's taste changes over the years. Will the audience in $70$ years ago like a different kind of movies with us. Or are people the same? This might also influent Disney's filming decision."
